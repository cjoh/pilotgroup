# Persona Archetypes — Domain-Agnostic Library

Use these archetypes as building blocks when generating personas. Mix and match across dimensions to create realistic, diverse cohorts. Every persona should combine traits from multiple dimensions — never use an archetype as a complete persona on its own.

## Engagement Level

### Enthusiast
- Arrives excited, reads ahead, asks questions before you finish explaining
- Risk: may dominate group dynamics, overlook flaws out of excitement
- Friction: feels held back by pacing designed for others

### Skeptic
- Arms crossed, needs to see evidence before buying in
- Risk: may dismiss good content prematurely, may influence others negatively
- Value: catches real problems that enthusiasts miss
- Friction: resists experiential/reflective exercises, wants data and proof

### Passive Observer
- Present but not actively engaging, takes notes quietly, won't volunteer
- Risk: may absorb less than they appear to, hard to gauge satisfaction
- Friction: feels invisible in interactive formats, won't speak up about problems

### Overachiever
- Does extra work, seeks bonus material, wants to go deeper than designed
- Risk: frustration when content is surface-level, may derail with tangential questions
- Friction: perceives anything basic as wasting their time

## Experience Level

### Expert
- Deep domain knowledge, evaluates content against professional experience
- Risk: bored by fundamentals, may reject content that contradicts their mental models
- Friction: "I already know this" syndrome, impatient with introductory material

### Novice
- New to the domain, needs clear foundations and safe space to learn
- Risk: overwhelmed by jargon or assumed knowledge, afraid to ask questions
- Friction: gaps in assumed prerequisites, pace too fast, unfamiliar terminology

### Adjacent Professional
- Comes from a related field, has transferable knowledge but different vocabulary
- Risk: makes incorrect assumptions based on their field's conventions
- Friction: translation problems between domains, feels "close but not quite"

### Career Changer
- Switching fields entirely, highly motivated but starting from zero
- Risk: imposter syndrome, may over-index on credentials and validation
- Friction: needs "why this matters" framing, not just "how it works"

## Processing Style

### Analyzer
- Wants data, frameworks, models, and logical structure
- Consumes content methodically, builds mental models
- Friction: frustrated by anecdotes without evidence, narrative-heavy content

### Storyteller
- Learns through narrative, examples, case studies, and human connection
- Remembers stories long after forgetting frameworks
- Friction: dislikes abstract theory without concrete examples or human context

### Doer
- Learns by doing, wants hands-on exercises, templates, and practice
- Skims theory to get to the "now try it" section
- Friction: lecture-heavy or passive content, theory without application

### Connector
- Sees relationships between ideas, synthesizes across domains
- Wants to know how this connects to other things they know
- Friction: siloed content that doesn't acknowledge broader context

## Access Needs

### Non-Native Speaker
- Processes content in second (or third) language
- Friction: idioms, cultural references, rapid speech, dense text, humor that doesn't translate
- Need: clear language, visual aids, written summaries, slower pacing

### Time-Constrained
- Can only engage in limited windows (parent, caregiver, multiple jobs)
- Friction: long unbroken sessions, homework/follow-up requirements, synchronous-only content
- Need: modular structure, async options, clear "minimum viable" path

### Accessibility Needs
- Physical, cognitive, or sensory access requirements
- Friction: unlabeled images, no captions, mouse-only interfaces, poor color contrast, no alt text
- Need: WCAG compliance, multiple modalities, flexible interaction methods

### Low-Bandwidth / Low-Tech
- Limited internet, older devices, shared computers
- Friction: video-heavy content, large downloads, real-time collaboration tools
- Need: text-first content, offline options, low-resource alternatives

## Friction Generators Checklist

Every persona should have at least one genuine friction point. Use this checklist during generation:

- [ ] **Pacing friction**: Content too fast or too slow for this persona
- [ ] **Depth friction**: Content too shallow or too deep
- [ ] **Format friction**: Delivery method doesn't match learning style
- [ ] **Relevance friction**: Content doesn't connect to their specific context
- [ ] **Language friction**: Jargon, reading level, cultural assumptions
- [ ] **Access friction**: Physical, technical, or time-based barriers
- [ ] **Trust friction**: Source credibility, evidence quality, tone
- [ ] **Engagement friction**: Interactive style doesn't match their comfort level
- [ ] **Representation friction**: Doesn't see themselves or their context reflected
- [ ] **Application friction**: Can't see how to use this in their actual life/work
